# AAMI - Automated Among Us Mod Installer

![AAMI Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NyphoX/AutomatedAmongUsModInstaller/master/AmongUs_ModInstaller/aami.ico)

AAMI is a standalone tool that is designed to simplify the process of modding Among Us.\
It is intended to be used with the Steam version of the game.

The goal is to stop players from having to perform  the same tedious copy-paste tasks, whenever a new version of their favorite mod is released or Among Us itself is updated. Simply select the desired mod from a list, mod your game with a single click, and start playing. Switch between different mod versions or even completely different mods in an instant. Or just start a quick round of vanilla Among Us while still keeping your mods installed. And if something is outdated, just remove it with a single click.

AAMI is currently only developed for Windows.

## IMPORTANT

__Before__ using AAMI, make sure your Steam installation of Among Us is "clean". This means that there is no mod installed and only the base Among Us game files are present. If you are unsure if this is the case, do a clean reinstall of Among Us following these steps:
 1. Open Steam and click on Library > Right-Click on Among Us > Manage > Browse Local Files. Keep this window open.
 2. Again, click on Library > Right-Click on Among Us > Manage > Uninstall. Confirm the uninstall prompt and wait until it is finished.
 3. In the explorer window from step 1., check if there are any leftover files. Delete everything that is in this folder.
 4. Open Steam and install Among Us as usual. You can now use AAMI and it will never mess up your Among Us folder again.

## Supported Mods

AAMI currently supports the following mods (more to come):
- [Sherrif Mod](https://github.com/Woodi-dev/Among-Us-Sheriff-Mod)
- [The Other Roles](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles)
- [Town of Impostors](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors)

## Why is mod "XYZ" not available?

If the mod is on GitHub, create a new [issue](https://github.com/NyphoX/AutomatedAmongUsModInstaller/issues) and link to the missing mod. If the mod just has to be extracted into the Among Us game folder, it can be added with an one-liner. If not, AAMI might need to be changed to support a wider variety of mods. If you know how to, you may also just create a pull request that I will merge afterwards.
